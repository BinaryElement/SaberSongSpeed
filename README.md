# SaberSongSpeed
Program to expand/compress beatmaps for speed-adjusted songs.

This is literally a windows form made in Visual Studio, and the actual code behind it is pretty gross, so it's *lazy as hell*. But it works like a charm.  It even adjusts barrier length (something I didn't think of until it killed me lmao).  If anyone ever sees a reason to use it, here it is!
